Team PathFinder at the [CTC12 Tourism Hack](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC12)

Pathfinder is a web application that allows the user to generate a Google map route through points of interest within Aberdeen. The waypoints are categorized under castles, distilleries and plaques.

The repository also contains code for scrapers that fetch data from the VisitScotland site, as well as [Ian Watts' Plaque Scraper](https://github.com/watty62/PlaqueScraper).
