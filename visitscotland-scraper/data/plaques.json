[{"Name":"Robin Lawrence (1892 - 1968)","Description":"Pioneering medical scientist. Soon after qualifying as a medical doctor Lawrence was diagnosed with diabetes. At the time, in the early 20th century, a disease such as this was normally fatal. Having moved to Florence to spend his remaining time there he was called back to Britain by his friend G.Harrison at King's College Hospital, London, with the message 'I have got some insulin. It works. Come back quick.'\n\nLawrence quickly learned how to manage diabetes and became a leading specialist in the field. His books, The Diabetic Life and The Diabetic ABC both ran to numerous editions. He and his close friends are credited with creation of the Diabetic Department at King's College Hospital, of which he subsequently became head. In 1934 with the public support of his friend and patient the novelist H.G.Wells he founded the Diabetic Association, now the British Diabetic Association. He was the Chairman of its executive council from 1934 to 1961. In 1950 he was involved in founding the International Diabetic Federation, of which body he was President until 1958.","Category":"Plaques","Latitude":"57.1369526","Longitude":"-2.1039839","Url":null,"HasFee":false,"TelephoneNumber":null,"IsAccessible":false,"HasParking":false},{"Name":"George Russell Gowans (1843 - 1924)","Description":"Artist.
